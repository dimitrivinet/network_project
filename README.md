### Choice: FTP

To use the server:
 - modify ADDR and PORT in the define section of server.c and client.c to the desired ip adress and port,
 - launch make in a terminal,
 - launch the server file in a terminal
 - launch the client file in another terminal,
 - type the name of a file to be sent (must be in the same directory as the client file),
 - the file received by the server will be in the "files" directory.

Caution, in only works with text files for now.
